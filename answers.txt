1. 
2. Outputs 10 9. The output operator is after the variable name therefore the value returned is the value before the variable was decreased by --. The 9 is then output by the second println as the variable has changed.
3. Prints out 9 9, since the output operator is now before the variable name meaning the new variable is returned in the first println.
4.i x = 4
4.ii y = 7
5. As the number 1 in binary is represented as 000001. A bitshift of n would move the 1 to the left of magnitude 2^n, so 000010, 000100, ...
6. int right = (z & x) >> 5; System.out.println(right);
